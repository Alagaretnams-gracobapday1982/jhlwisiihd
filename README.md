Oh man, just watched The Alto Knights and I’m like, what even was that?! 😂 I can’t tell if I loved it or was just completely puzzled half the time. Honestly, it was a rollercoaster. The actors were on point though, you know what I mean? That main guy, what's-his-name, he just had this… thing. Anyway, I could watch him read the phone book and be entertained.

You know how I told you I was gonna download the movie? Well, I ended up watching it with like zero expectations lol. And the plot twists, I didn’t see half of them coming. The whole thing is just wild. There’s this one scene where everything goes quiet and then BAM, chaos. Like, I almost spilled my drink. 😂

> So, there's this part where the crew just starts breaking into song? Seriously. It’s like they forgot they’re supposed to be gangsters. I was like, is this a musical now? Who signed off on that? Hats off to creativity, but c’mon, it was a bit much at times! 

And the ending? Okay, no spoilers, but WHAT?! I had to pause and just stare at the wall for a second. Did that really happen? I mean, why does everyone always think they need to go for some big twist? Sometimes all you want is a wrap-up, you feel me?

Let me just say, if you decide to watch the movie, keep your expectations in check 😅. It’s like, could they squeeze any more randomness in there? It’s exhausting but in a kinda fun way. A guilty pleasure? Yeah, let’s call it that. I’m tired now, but good tired. Like I just ran a marathon of bizarre plot points. 🏃‍♂️💨

console.log(I don't even know why I'm doing this);

Anyway, enough of my rambling. Need to catch some Z's now, brain is FRIED. Hit me up tomorrow? I wanna hear what you think. Don't say I didn't warn you! 🤪
